- Show the total number of the result which can let the user know how many images are similar to my picture in your engine.

- Classify the images of the result, which can let the user browse the result  distinctly and the tags should be distinct.

- User can click one tag, and the system should show the images which hold this tag only.

- There should present a favorites and the user can add the images of the result to the favorites. And if he or she click the favorites, the image search engine are supposed to show the favorite images.

- Provide a **Clear button** to search image again
